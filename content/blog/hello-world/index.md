## Hey!
As a fresh start, I will include a path to resources that I experienced and helped me earn AZ-900, DP-900, AI-900, PL-900 & SC-900 respectively Azure, Data, Artificial Intelligence, Power Platform & Microsoft Security, Compliance and Identity Fundamentals.

Following the same rhythm with increasing effort, I was able to get certified as an **Azure Developer, Administrator, Security Engineer & DevOps Engineer Expert.**

Microsoft offers a variety of foundational certifications with the exam code XX-900, depending on the field of interest.

**if you are completely new to the cloud, AZ-900; it should be your first target.**

For more details about the certifications Journey, Microsoft provides an answer to the query and gives a deeper view.
Quickly check out these links and come back to complete the rest.

Microsoft fundamentals are designed to ensure that you have a good foundation on the skills that are measured in the exam & being able to describe them.

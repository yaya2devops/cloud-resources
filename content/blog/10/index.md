## SecOps
The term ‚ÄúSecOps‚Äù is a combination of the words ‚ÄúSecurity‚Äù and ‚ÄúOperations.‚Äù It refers to the practice of integrating security into an organization‚Äôs overall DevOps strategy. The goal of SecOps is to secure applications and systems throughout the software development lifecycle, from design and development through production and delivery. By automating security controls and processes, SecOps can help organizations speed up application delivery while reducing risk.

So, secOps refers to a company's integration of internal information security and IT operations procedures to enhance communication and lower risks.

Let's start with the fundamentals. The AWS Developer Exam is intended to assess your knowledge and skills in developing and maintaining AWS-hosted applications. It covers a wide range of topics related to developement such as storage, networking, and security.

To pass the exam, you must have a solid understanding of these concepts as well as the ability to apply them in real-world scenarios.

With that said, here are the resources that I found most helpful in my journey to becoming an AWS Developer:

# [AWS Documentation](https://aws.amazon.com/fr/certification/certified-developer-associate/)

When preparing for the AWS Developer Exam, the official AWS documentation is a good place to start. The AWS Developer Guide is included, as well as a variety of other resources such as tutorials, code samples and instructions. The AWS documentation is constantly updated and is an invaluable resource for understanding the platform's various services and features.

You can find more learning material within the link provided above.

# [AWS Training and Certification](https://www.aws.training/)

Aside from the official documentation, AWS provides a number of training and certification programs to help you prepare for the exam. Online courses, instructor-led training, and even practice exams are examples. I found the online courses to be especially beneficial because they provided a structured learning experience while also allowing me to learn at my own pace. Some popular courses to consider are AWS Developer: Building on AWS and AWS Certified Developer - Associate.

Log from [here](https://www.aws.training/) and search for the course.

# [GitHub Labs](https://github.com/ACloudGuru-Resources/course-aws-certified-developer-associate)

Exploring sample applications and code repositories is another excellent resource for preparing for the AWS Developer Exam. These can assist you in understanding how to build and deploy real-world applications on the AWS platform and are an excellent way to practice your skills.

I found these hands-on very useful, and I encourage you to try 'em out.

Stephane is a good one, he is able to break down complex concepts into easy-to-understand pieces that are able to engage and motivate students. This course should cover everything you need to know.

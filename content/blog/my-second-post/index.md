**In fact, this certification assisted me in understanding what happens in the cloud and what an Azure administrator does. <br> This blog will provide you with the resources you need to gain that knowledge and sit for the exam.**

Foremost, the exam code for the certification is AZ-104, as every time with Microsoft, **the [open source documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/exams/az-104)** should be your first leap.

- Make sure to give it enough time to read and try out these hands-on labs.

Watch this video from **[Yatharth Kapoor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nxEF1XswIo&t=427s)** before beginning your preparation, where he simply explains some great material for the certification in a short video. <br> I recall viewing it while I was stressed out and it helped me arrange my thoughts.




### Now some compressed material!
**[Andrew Brown course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10PbGbTUSAg&t=426s) is free and available on freeCodeCamp Youtube channel, covering all the topics of the exam.**

- This course will get you steps into your preparation.


#### Importantly, you cannot prepare for an Azure certification without going through what
